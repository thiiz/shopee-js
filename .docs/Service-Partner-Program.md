About Service Partner Program
The Service Partner Program applies to all Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) with access to the Shopee Open Platform. The program aims to reward ISVs who demonstrate excellence in application security, API activity and commercial achievements.



Based on your performance, you can achieve top tiers in our program ranking, and enjoy Shopee Open Platform’s endorsement as a Premium Service Partner. This in turn lets you grow your business and presence in the market(s) that you operate in.



However, do note that ISVs enrolled in the program who perform poorly in the non-commercial categories will be penalized.

Eligibility
All ISVs who have an Open Platform account will be automatically enrolled in the Service Partner Program unless informed otherwise. You will need to have a valid Open Platform account by the end of the quarter to be eligible for the upcoming enrollment in the subsequent quarter.

🔹 For ISVs in Indonesia (ID): You must complete registration for the program before you can be enrolled. Please register here.



The timeline of our Service Partner Program enrollment is as follows:




Results will be finalized on the last calendar day of every quarter, and will be announced via email on the 2nd Monday of Month 1 of the new quarter.



Only eligible ISVs that meet our criteria, and have qualified as a Premium Service Partner in at least one market will receive an email which includes the quarterly performance report. They will also be awarded for their good performance.

⚠️ Note
ISVs which are not qualified to become a Premium Service Partner for the quarter will not receive a quarterly performance report.
ISVs are assessed based on performance in each individual market, and not on an aggregated basis. Rewards will also be provided only in the markets that have met our criteria.
Scoring


You will be scored for the Service Partner Program in these 4 categories:

Platform Compliance
Application Security
API Activity
Commercial Performance


ISVs must fulfill all requirements under the Premium criteria in the 4 categories to be considered a Premium Service Partner each quarter:


* Valid Security documents refer to:

Penetration Test reports produced by a CREST Registered Penetration Tester or other equivalent certified penetration tester (case-by-case basis)
** Active users refer to sellers with shops actively using your APP(s) who have had at least 1 order in the quarter of assessment
*** Acquired sellers need to be active new users on Shopee Platform to count towards this metric



Note 1: Commercial performance criteria for different markets are as follows:

⚠️ Note
[Important] Shopee reserves the right to exclude certain ISVs from our Service Partner Program if they are found to be violating our Platform Partner Rules, such as by engaging in crawling activities.  This is even if they have met the criteria above.
Criteria above are also subject to changes as and when Shopee deems it to be necessary.


Here’s an example of the quarter’s scoring:



Example 1

ISV Y services Singapore (SG), Malaysia (MY), and CB sellers. Its commercial performance for the quarter is as follows:


For the categories of Application Security and API Activity, ISV Y has:

i) Good API performance and activity

ii) Submitted a valid security document (Security certification by ISO 27001)
iii) Ensured that there are no overdue vulnerabilities found in their IT infrastructure throughout the quarter



In this example, ISV Y only meets the local commercial requirements for the Singapore market, on top of the Application Security and API Activity requirements to become a Premium Service Partner.



Note that total commercial performance does not count as it is assessed based on performance in each individual market, and not on an aggregated basis.



For example, the total commercial performance of (1) 900 active users, (2) 9 new sellers acquired, and (3) 3,600 ADO across the 3 markets may seem to fulfill the Malaysia market requirement as well. However, as commercial requirements are evaluated on a market-by-market basis, ISV Y is not qualified to be a Premium Service Partner in Malaysia.



Example 2

ISV Z services only CB sellers. It has 5,000 active sellers and acquired 100 active sellers in the quarter. The commercial performance of the ISVs are as follow:


It also has good API performance and activity. However, for the categories of Application Security, ISV Z has:

(i) Yet to submit any valid security documents

(ii) Yet to rectify 1 high-risk vulnerability found in their IT infrastructure, after 1 warning or 2 weeks without a response (i.e. overdue vulnerability)



In this example, although ISV Z has excellent commercial performance, ISV Z will not qualify to be a Premium Service Partner in any market, and be classified in the “Poor” tier. This is because ISV Z has poor application security, which has the potential to cause a data leakage.



Depending on the severity of the vulnerability and non-compliance by ISV Z, Shopee may revoke ISV Z’s Open Platform access to protect Shopee’s user data.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
General
1. What is the difference between the Shopee-Certified Enablers Program and Service Partner Program?

The Service Partner Program offered on Open Platform is strictly for ISVs who have access to Shopee Open Platform. Although some enablers also have access to Open Platform, this program focuses on security and commercial performance, instead of operational and engagement performance.

Scoring
1. How is “active seller” defined?

An active seller must have made a successful functional API call via your APP in the last 90 days. The seller must also have had at least 1 order in the last 90 days.



2. What counts as a successful acquisition of a seller?

Acquisition of a seller is only counted if:

(a) the ISV was the active party in bringing the seller onto the Shopee platform, i.e. seller must not have been selling on Shopee platform and then started using services provided by you afterwards, and 
(b) the seller is an active seller as defined above in Scoring FAQ 1.



3. How often am I required to submit a valid Security Document to Shopee?

Penetration Test Reports: You are required to submit a valid penetration test report once every year. If there are significant changes to your IT assets, a new penetration test report should be submitted to reflect those changes.

Security Certifications: These only need to be submitted once during their validity period. You must resubmit the certification once it expires or is renewed.



4. How does Shopee know if we have vulnerabilities in our system?

Shopee performs regular vulnerability screening on the IT assets that you declare on your Open Platform Console. If you do not declare your IT assets, Shopee cannot assess your IT security, and you will be considered to have not met the Application Security requirements. Shopee strongly recommends that you declare and update your IT assets regularly, to meet the Application Security requirements and secure marketing benefits for your business.



5. What is considered an unrectified vulnerability?

A vulnerability is only considered unrectified if you do not complete the recommended rectification from Shopee by the allocated time in the quarter. To avoid this, please regularly visit the Open Platform Vulnerability Dashboard , and perform the recommended actions ASAP.



6. Can you provide some examples of a valid Security Document?

You may refer to the file here for a list of acceptable Security Document that Shopee accepts. You can redact detailed portions of the security documents if you believe that they are sensitive information, but it should still show the vulnerability, rating and remediation status of your IT infrastructure.



No open critical or high vulnerabilities should also exist in your report.

Benefits and Penalties


1. Other than exposure on Shopee’s seller platforms, how do I find out more about market-specific marketing benefits?

You can find out about market-specific marketing benefits by reaching out to your Relationship Managers (RMs). You may also raise a ticket via our Shopee Ticket System.



2. If I meet the criteria in the middle of a quarter, will I immediately become a Premium Service Partner?

No, you will only become a Premium Service Partner in the next quarter as your performance is calculated on a quarterly basis.



3. What is the period of assessment for each screening?

The screening will be based on your performance from the first to last day of each quarter.

For example, a screening for 2022 Q2 will assess the ISV’s performance from 1 April 2022 to 30 June 2022.

Miscellaneous
1. Who should I contact for more information about the rewards?

You may reach out to your Relationship Manager (RM) or your local Product Support team if you have any questions. You will be able to find this detail in the email sent to you if you are eligible for the program. You may also raise a ticket via our Shopee Ticket System.



2. Why am I not onboarded as a Premium Service Partner, or excluded from receiving benefits even though I have met the criteria for both the commercial and security performance categories?

Please note that we reserve the right to exclude certain ISVs from our Service Partner Program if they are found to be violating our Platform Partner Rules. Other reasons could include legal issues that prohibit us from granting you certain benefits.



3. How will I know if I am subsequently offboarded from the program in the next quarter?

If you do not receive an email confirmation by the 2nd Monday of the 1st month in the quarter, you can assume that you are no longer a Premium Service Partner. You will not be receiving any of the rewards as well.



4. When will we receive the rewards and for how long?

Each reward cycle lasts from the date of announcement until the 2nd Monday of the new quarter.
