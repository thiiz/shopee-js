FAQ
Q: Is it allowed to bind orders across shops for a first-mile tracking number?A: Yes, but make sure that orders across shops use the same transshipment warehouse. Because the API has authentication, when calling the v2.first_mile.bind_first_mile_tracking_number API, only one shop's order can be called for one call, so please make sure that order_sn and shop_id match for each time you call.

Q: Will the order status change after successful binding?

A: Yes, after binding FM successfully and being scanned, the order status of all orders being bound will be updated from PROCESSED to SHIPPED.

Q: Should I ship the order and print the airway bill first or first mile bind first?

A: The correct order is to ship the order first, then print the airway bill, then bind the first mile tracking number for order.

Q: How can I check the first-mile tracking number of an order?

A: You can use v2.logistics.get_tracking_number API and upload the request parameter response_optional_fields: first_mile_tracking_number then you can get the first-mile tracking number of an order.

Q: What can first_mile_tracking_number status be bound?

A: You can query the first-mile tracking number status through v2.first_mile.get_detail API.

1. If ship_method is a pickup:

If the first_mile_tracking_number is just generated, the status is NOT_AVAILABLE, at that time, the order can be bound.
If the first_mile_tracking_number tracking status is ORDER_RECEIVED, it means that there are orders that have already been bound, and you can continue to bind other orders.
If the first_mile_tracking_number status is PICKED_UP, indicating that the parcels have been collected by the channel, and can no longer bind the order.
If the first_mile_tracking_number status is DELIVERED, which means that the parcel has arrived at the warehouse, and orders can no longer be bound.

2. If ship_method is drop off or self-deliver: there is no status restriction.

Q: Does self-deliver still need to call the API for first mile binding?A: Yes, even self-delivery is the offline ship action for sellers, but you still need to call v2.first_mile.bind_first_mile_tracking_number API for the first-mile binding.

Q: In what state can I unbind the first mile tracking number for an order?

A: 1. If ship_method is a pick up, only if the first_mile_tracking_number status is ORDER_RECEIVED can be unbind.
