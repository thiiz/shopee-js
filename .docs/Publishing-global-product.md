After creating a global product, you can publish the global product to each market, but the global product can only have one shop product in each market.



Below we will explain the API call flow.

Step 1: Getting the list of publishable shops
API: v2.global_product.get_publishable_shop

You can get the list of publishable shops for global products through this API, but we will not return the corresponding shops for the following cases:

shops that have not done the shop authorization
SIP affiliated shops
Shops of published market
Step 2: Getting the shop channel
API: v2.logistics.get_channel_list

You need to call v2.logistics.get_channel_list API and select the channel with enable=true and mask_channel_id=0 for shop products. If you publish global products without uploading shop channels, we will choose the enabled and available shop channels for you by default.

Step 3: Publishing global product
API: v2.global_product.create_publish_task

For the optional fields of v2.global_product.create_publish_task , if you do not upload, Shopee will do some processing and upload to shop products. If you upload, it will be a custom value and Shopee will not do any processing. The specific logic is as follows:

Field Name	Upload the custom value
item_name	YES: Seller need to translate into local language then uploadNO: Shopee will help translate into the local language
description_info/description	YES: Seller need to translate into local language then uploadNO: Shopee will help translate into the local language
original_price	YES: Seller need to upload the price in local currencyNO: Shopee calculates local prices based on the price of global products and calculation formulas.
tier_variation--name	YES: Seller need to translate into local language then uploadNO: Shopee will help translate into the local language
tier_variation--option_list--option	YES: Seller need to translate into local language then uploadNO: Shopee will help translate into the local language
image	YES: Seller uploads the custom imagesNO: Shopee will copy the images of global products


After a successful API call, you will get a publish_task_id.

API: v2.global_product.get_publish_task_result

This API will return whether the publish task was successful or not. If it succeeds, it will return the item_id, shop_id, and region information, if it fails, it will return the specific reason for the failure.



Please note: If the published shop is the SIP primary shop, then after the successful publication, Shopee will automatically publish the global product to the affiliated shops under the SIP primary shop.

Step 4: Getting the list of published shop products
API: v2.global_product.get_published_list

API will return the item_id and shop_id of all the shops that have been successfully published for this global product, including the shop products that Shopee automatically publishes to the affiliated shops.



Please note: This API does not return shop products that have been published but have not done the shop authorization.
