Before creating a product, you need to get the category, attributes, brand,days to ship, whether the category supports size chart and other information through API to get prepared for creating products.

1. Category
Each product must have a unique category, please get Shopee category data by v2.product.get_category API. Each node's category has a unique category_id.

1.1 Global category data
Shopee's category tree data applies to all markets, but according to the local policies of the market, some of the categories we set to market prohibited. That is, when you call  v2.product.get_category API with a Malaysian shop, you can get category A, but through a Singapore shop, you can not get it.Policies for cross-border and domestic sales are also different, so category data will also vary. For different types of sellers, there are also small differences in the supported category data.



So, in order for you to get the most accurate category data, it is recommended to obtain it according to shop_id.

1.2 Category tree
v2.product.get_category API returns all available categories for the shop.

parent_category_id=0, it means this is the first level category, otherwise, it will return the parent category id of this category.

has_children=false means the last level category, otherwise, it means that this category has children. Please note that only the category_id with has_children=false can be used to create or update products.



For example, if the category tree path is Level 1 category→Level 2 category→Level 3 category, the API return will be



"category_list": [

     {

       "display_category_name": "Level 1 category",

       "has_children":true,

       "category_id": 105899,

       "original_category_name": "Level 1 category",

       "parent_category_id": 0

     },

     {

       "display_category_name": "Level 2 category",

       "has_children": true,

       "category_id":109889,

       "original_category_name": "Level 2 category",

       "parent_category_id":105899

     },

     {

       "display_category_name": "Level 3 category",

       "has_children":false,

       "category_id":107839,

       "original_category_name": "Level 3 category",

       "parent_category_id":109889

     }



]

​​

1.3 Recommend categories
In order to help sellers quickly find the category of the product, you can also call ​​​​​​​​v2.product.category_recommend API, API will return a list of recommended categories based on the product name and product image.

2. Attribute
Each product category has different attribute data. The “v2.product.get_attribute_tree” API will return the attribute data for the given “category_id”. However, please note that only last-level categories can retrieve attribute data. A last-level category is defined as one where the value of the “has_children” field under the “category_list” section returned via the “v2.product.get_category” API is false.

2.1 Required and optional Attributes
When creating or updating products, all required attributes must be uploaded, while optional attributes can be provided based on your needs. In the “v2.product.get_attribute_tree” API response, “is_mandatory”: true indicates a required attribute, and “is_mandatory”: false indicates an optional attribute.

2.2 Type of attributes
We classify attribute types based on factors such as whether the attribute value supports multiple selections, whether it allows custom input, and whether the attribute value is provided. You can check the “input_type” field in the “v2.product.get_attribute_tree” API response for relevant information.



input_type	Type	Definition	Description	Custom value is allowed	Attribute values are provided
1	int	SINGLE_DROP_DOWN	Single-select dropdown; Sellers can only choose one option from the list of attribute values (“attribute_value_list”) returned by the API to upload.	No	Yes
2	int	SINGLE_COMBO_BOX	Single-select dropdown + text input field; Sellers can either choose one option from the list of attribute values (“attribute_value_list”) returned by the API to upload, or set a custom value.	Yes	Yes
3	int	FREE_TEXT_FILED	Text input field; Sellers can set a custom value.	Yes	No
4	int	MULTI_DROP_DOWN	Multi-select dropdown; Sellers can select multiple options from the list of attribute values (“attribute_value_list”) returned by the API to upload.	No	Yes
5	int	MULTI_COMBO_BOX	Multi-select dropdown + text input field; Sellers can select multiple options from the list of attribute values (“attribute_value_list”) returned by the API to upload, or set a custom value.	Yes	Yes


*The following figure shows an example with “input_type”: 2 (SINGLE_COMBO_BOX). Sellers can select a value from the attribute list (Elliptical Trainers), or set a custom value by clicking the 'Add a new item' button and filling it in.







Please note:

For product attributes that support multi-select dropdowns, you can get the maximum number of attribute values that can be uploaded through the “max_value_count” parameter.
You can get the list of attribute values provided by Shopee for upload through the “attribute_value_list” parameter.


2.3 Data types of attribute values
Attribute values have defined data types, and you need to upload the attribute values according to the required data type. You can obtain the data type of the attribute value through the “input_validation_type” field returned by the “v2.product.get_attribute_tree” API.



input_validation_type	Type	Description	Remarks
0	int	VALIDATOR_NO_VALIDATE_TYPE	
1	int	VALIDATOR_INT_TYPE	
2	int	VALIDATOR_STRING_TYPE	
3	int	VALIDATOR_FLOAT_TYPE	
4	int	VALIDATOR_DATE_TYPE, including two formats：
DD/MM/YYYYY, e.g. 31/06/2021
MM/YYYYY, e.g. 06/2021
When adding or editing a product, for attributes with a date data type, please enter the timestamp in Unix timestamp format. However, when retrieving detailed product attribute values, the “original_value_name” will return the value in a readable date format.


Please note:

For the date type attribute, there are two formats: one is MONTH/YEAR (06/2021) and the other is DAY/MONTH/YEAR (31/06/2021). You can check the “date_format_type” field in the “v2.product.get_attribute_tree” API response for details.
When creating or updating a product, you need to upload the attribute value as a Unix timestamp in the “original_value_name” field. However, when retrieving product information, the “original_value_name” field in the “v2.product.get_item_base_info” API response will return the date in a format such as 06/2021 or 31/06/2021.
2.4 Attribute value units
For example, for the length attribute, we provide sellers with options to choose units such as “cm” and “m”. Therefore, you need to first understand which attribute values require a unit and which units are available for these attribute values. You can call the ” v2.product.get_attribute_tree” API to obtain this information.



When the returned parameter “format_type”: 2 (FORMAT_QUANTITATIVE_WITH_UNIT) is present, it means the attribute value requires a unit, and the” attribute_unit_list” parameter will return the available units for that attribute value. When the returned parameter “format_type”: 1 (FORMAT_NORMAL) is present, it means the attribute value does not require a unit.



*In the attribute value list provided by Shopee, we display the value and the unit separately. Specifically, the “name” field in the “attribute_value_list” will return the value of the attribute (i.e. 5kg), while the “value_unit” field will return the unit of the attribute value (i.e. kg).





2.5 Parent attribute and parent brand
For example, for the “Weight Type” attribute, the available attribute values are “Body Weights” and “Barbells”. The “Body Weights Type” attribute is associated with the “Body Weights” value. Therefore, when the seller selects “Body Weights” for the “Weight Type” attribute, the “Body Weights Type” attribute will be displayed, and we recommend that the seller fill in the corresponding value.



*Selecting “Barbells” value does not show the Body Weights Type attribute


*Selecting “Body Weights” value displays the Body Weights Type attribute

3. Brand
You can upload the brand information for the product, but we will require certain categories to fill in the brand information, and each category supports a different list of brands, so please call v2.product.get_brand_list API to get the brand list data supported by a category (can only be requested with the last level category).
