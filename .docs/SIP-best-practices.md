What is SIP?
The full name of SIP is Shopee International Platform (Shopee International Platform). After participating in the SIP project, Shopee will help you operate the shop , including setting up and submitting marketing activities according to the characteristics of the local market. After opening the shop, you only need to bind the receiving account in advance, regularly check the product inventory, participate in various promotion to confirm the price, and deliver the goods according to the delivery time limit!

Terminology:
P shop (primary shop) : In the SIP agent operation mode, the shop independently operated by the seller is also called the primary shop;

A shop (affiliated shop) : Shopee helps the seller to operate the agency shop, also known as the affiliated shop;

CB SIP (cross border SIP) : If cross-border sellers operated the primary shop, we call that CB SIP mode ;

Local SIP：If local sellers operated the primary shop, we call that local SIP mode ;

SIP rate: Applies to CBSIP only. The SIP price adjustment ratio refers to the discount rate set by the seller for the affiliated shop based on the cost price of the product. When the product is sold in the affiliated shop, Shopee will automatically calculate the final settlement price for the seller based on the cost price of the product and the SIP price adjustment ratio.

SIP Item price: The cost price of the product, based on which Shopee will calculate the selling price of the A shop product and the settlement price of the product.

Settlement price: The settlement price of the product, Shopee will settle to the seller based on this price.

2. Product Management
2.1 Product information logic


Info	Sync logic
Item base info (item name/description.etc)	Create: After the seller creates a P shop product, Shopee will automatically translate the product information into the local A shop language and create an A shop product.
Update: If the seller modifies the P shop product, Shopee will automatically synchronize the new product information to the A shop product.
Item status	If the P shop product is unlisted or deleted, the A shop product will also be unlisted or deleted. Seller cannot update the item status of the A shop product.
Item stock	The product stock of P shop is equal to the product stock of A shop. For example, there are 2 A shops under P shop, A shop1 and A shop2, and the stock of P shop=10, then the stock of A shop1= A shop2=10. When A shop1 sells 1 item, the stock of P shop=A shop1=A shop2=9.
Item price	When the seller updates the product price in P shop, Shopee will synchronize it to the product price in A shop.
2.2 Price logic
SIP Item Price

v2.product.get_item_base_info And v2.product.get_model_list API response:

3.1.2 Local SIP


Shopee automatically synchronizes the SIP A shop order to the SIP P shop, so you only need to obtain and fulfill the SIP P shop order list. Those P shop orders generated by A shop, the recipient of the order is the Shopee transshipment warehouse located in Local, the Shopee transshipment warehouse will carry out cross-border delivery and finally send it to the Buyer.





Note⚠️

For the order push mechanism. The orders of P shops and A shops will be pushed at the same time. For CB SIP sellers, they need to pay attention to the push of P shops and A shops. For Local SIP sellers, they only need to pay attention to the push of P shops.
